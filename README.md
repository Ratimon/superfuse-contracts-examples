<h1>ðŸ“šCrosschain Smart Contracts Example generated by Superfuse ðŸ“š</h1>


This repo shows how `Superfuse` works. it includes some examples featuriing **OPStack** interoperability at smart contract level.

These are illustrated by modifying their smart contracts components using our [`Superfuse Wizard`](https://github.com/Ratimon/superfuse-wizard). Then, [`superfuse-forge`](https://github.com/Ratimon/superfuse-forge) could be used to deploy such customized contracts in production.

## What is it for ?

This **cross-chaibn** building block is intended to better introduce and onboard blockchain builder into `superchain` 's [interoperability](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/interop/explainer).


While developer experience and security are our top priorities, we aim to provide the developer-focused educational tool, such that the new experimental **dApp** can be quicky bootstapped in **superchain** ecosystem. This greatly align with **Optimism** 's Interoperability roadmap.


## How It Works

`Superfuse` consists of:

1. `Superfuse Wizard` (**Web UI**)

We are building `Superfuse Wizard`, a code generator/ interactive educational playground to customize, mix & match, deploy **Interoperable** dApp .

2. `superfuse-forge` (**Framework/Library**)

We are also developing `redprint-forge`, a modular solidity-based framework to deploy sets of interoperable smart contracts. It works as an engine to:

- Provide type-safe deployment functions. This ensures correct type and order of arguments, enhancing security in smart contract development
- Allow create-2 based deployer  to guarantee the same address across the Superchain
- Save deployment schemas in **json** file
- Separate into each of modular and customizable components
- Provide reusable test suites with All-Solidity-based so no context switching, no new syntax
