<h1>ðŸ“šCrosschain Smart Contracts Example generated by Superfuse Toolkit ðŸ“š</h1>


This repo shows how `Superfuse` works. it includes some examples featuriing **OPStack** interoperability at smart contract level.

These are illustrated by modifying their smart contracts components using our [`Superfuse Wizard`](https://github.com/Ratimon/superfuse-wizard). Then, [`superfuse-forge`](https://github.com/Ratimon/superfuse-forge) could be used to deploy such customized contracts in production.

## What is it for ?

This **cross-chaibn** building block is intended to better introduce and onboard web3 developer into `superchain` 's [interoperability](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/interop/explainer).


While developer experience and security are our top priorities, we aim to provide the developer-focused educational tool, such that the new experimental **dApp** can be quicky bootstapped in **superchain** ecosystem. This greatly align with **Optimism** 's Interoperability roadmap.


## How It Works

`Superfuse` consists of:

1. `Superfuse Wizard` (**Web UI**)

We are building `Superfuse Wizard`, a code generator/ interactive educational playground to customize, mix & match, deploy **Interoperable** dApp .

2. `superfuse-forge` (**Framework/Library**)

We are also developing `redprint-forge`, a modular solidity-based framework to deploy sets of interoperable smart contracts. It works as an engine to:

- Provide type-safe deployment functions. This ensures correct type and order of arguments, enhancing security in smart contract development
- Allow create-2 based deployer  to guarantee the same address across the Superchain
- Save deployment schemas in **json** file
- Separate into each of modular and customizable components
- Provide reusable test suites with All-Solidity-based so no context switching, no new syntax


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Ratimon/superfuse-contracts-examples.git
```

2. Enter to the project directory:

```bash
cd superfuse-contracts-examples
```

3. Select the correct node verison:

```bash
nvm use v20.13.1
```

4. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

## Quickstart

1. Initialize the environment variables:

```bash
pnpm init:env
```

2. Start the development environment:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

This command will:

- Start the `supersim` local development environment
- Deploy the smart contracts to the two test networks

## Acknowledgement

This repository would not have been possible to build without the advanced iniatiative from opensource software including

- [superchainerc20-starter](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchainerc20-starter)
- [supersim](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim)

So, we are deeply thankful for their contributions in our web3 ecosystem.

If weâ€™ve overlooked anyone, please open an issue so we can correct it. While we always aim to acknowledge the inspirations and code we utilize, mistakes can happen in a team setting, and a reference might unintentionally be missed.
